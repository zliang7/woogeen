0. Build jsni module and place the woogeen_jsni.so file in lib/native/x86/ directory.

1. Configurate IP address and port of MCU server in src/config.json file.

2. Remove /usr/lib/woogeen_jsni.so if exists.
   If not, app will crash. This is a workaround of JSNI issue.

   $ adb remount
   $ adb shell rm -f /usr/lib/woogeen_jsni.so

3. Install the app to device.

   $ caf import
   $ caf install

4. Start surfaceserver before start the app. You can see a colorful triangle on screen.

   $ adb shell surfaceserver

5. Start the app.
   You can't touch the app icon because the homescreen is covered by surfacesever.
   To workaround, launch it with yunos studio or caf cli:

   $ caf run

6. (Optional) Quit the surfaceserver with CTRL-C to get rid of the triangle and shadow.
   But you have to start it again before the next app run.

7. Stop the app:

   $ adb shell pkill webrtc
